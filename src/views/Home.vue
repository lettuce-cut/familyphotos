    <h3>Family history is something extremely important to me. My dream has been to make a website
      to display all kinds of aspects of my geneaology, so that all my relatives (who are not members of the 
      church) might be able to see the beauties of our heritage.</h3>
    <h3>So take a look around under Browse to see if there are any familiar faces that you're curious to know more about!</h3>
